   Learn what it takes
Before students can figure out what they're interested in, they need to
learn what it takes.  That's why your six-month program kicks off with
a one-day conference at the University of Southern California.
Students will learn the core professional skills that will leave them
feeling empowered and ready to explore their interests beyond
their school's campus.

Your virtual coach

has your back
Once students learn what it takes, it's go-time! They will need
help along the way, so each student will have a virtual coach
who will be available based on the student's schedule. Coaches
help students narrow down their interests, meet professionals
in those fields, and support them in the way they need.

Transform conversations
into opportunities
There is a reason why the program is six months long.  We start with
simple introductions to professionals. Based on the student's goal
and schedule, the coach will provide one-on-one guidance on turning
simple introductions into professional opportunities, like mentorships,
job shadows, and internships.


Not a fit? Let's start over

These things take time. We give students time to build relationships, job shadow, and explore other
interests if their initial interest didn't work out. We're a big fan of 'Cross it off the list, you're one step closer!'
This isn't about locking our students down, but empowering them to actively
explore and find the best options for themselves.
