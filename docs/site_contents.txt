   Learn what it takes
Before students can figure out what they're interested in, they need to
learn what it takes.  That's why your six-month program kicks off with
a one-day conference at the University of Southern California.
Students will learn the core professional skills that will leave them
feeling empowered and ready to explore their interests beyond
their school's campus.

Your virtual coach

has your back
Once students learn what it takes, it's go-time! They will need
help along the way, so each student will have a virtual coach
who will be available based on the student's schedule. Coaches
help students narrow down their interests, meet professionals
in those fields, and support them in the way they need.

Transform conversations
into opportunities
There is a reason why the program is six months long.  We start with
simple introductions to professionals. Based on the student's goal
and schedule, the coach will provide one-on-one guidance on turning
simple introductions into professional opportunities, like mentorships,
job shadows, and internships.


Not a fit? Let's start over

These things take time. We give students time to build relationships, job shadow, and explore other
interests if their initial interest didn't work out. We're a big fan of 'Cross it off the list, you're one step closer!'
This isn't about locking our students down, but empowering them to actively
explore and find the best options for themselves.

"Skillify met our objective of increasing the confidence level of each student
and preparing them for their mentoring and interning programs. Students
were actively engaged and practiced networking skills in a highly animated
and beneficial professional setting. Shireen captivated our students with
her personal examples from her life and with her enthusiasm. They received
a great benefit from her workshop on networking. Our students thanked me
on the way out for providing this workshop. Their comments were that they
felt much more connected to each other as an academy and learned their
own commonalities and they learned practical tips like remembering to check
their emails daily! Thank you!! Skillify exceeded expectations and comes
highly recommended."

What are students saying?

�When I first heard about the Skillify program, I didn�t know what to think. The thought of networking and talking to adults scared
me. My friends and my parents convinced me to apply. I�m happy I did. Skillify is a great program. Not only did they help me talk to
new people, but they also helped me develop and grow my professional skills. All the staff care about you and working with your
Student Success Manager is great!! They spend one on one time with you and on anything you need.  Just ask, and they�ll be there
for you. One of the biggest ways my Student Success Manager helped me was connecting me with professionals in the nursing and
computer science field. I had an idea of what I wanted to pursue in college, but I could never narrow it down between nursing or
computer programming. Through the calls, I talked to 4 professionals from Skillify. From those four professionals, I was able to
connect with two more people. Every adult I called was super friendly and happy to answer my questions. Through weeks of
calling, asking questions about their jobs, and asking questions about college, I was able to get a better feel of what path
would be best for me. Skillify provides countless opportunities for me. I�m so proud to say I�m a Skillify student.�

What are parents saying?
Marina M.

I hope she will gain tools to make her feel
confident. Practical tools she can put to
use to demystify scary situations like
interviewing etc. She is already empowe-
red by having attended the conference.
She came home feeling inspired and
hopeful that there are more options out
there for her than she thought
there were.

Victoria loved her first conference and is
very excited to be part of the program. She
found Skillify on her own, applied, and
when accepted, asked me to let her attend.
I'm so happy that you created this program
to help guide her ambition.

Marcela R.

We are so grateful Stephanie was chosen for
this amazing opportunity. She is our oldest
and we didn't get the chance to continue
with college right after high school. She has
worked so hard to live her dream of college
and a career in Physical Therapy. Now with
Skillify we know she is a step closer to
making it a reality.

Malea came home very excited about the
program and the connections and friends
she made. She love her mentor Danyel and
is very excited to work with her. As a parent
I was very impressed with the com muni
cation, professionalism and how much all
the staff and interns were excited
to work with the kids.

Spencer was very enthusiastic with what
he learned at the conference and what he
learned about himself. His confidence level
rose and he understood the value of the
tools he is being introduced to. He is formu
lating goals and feels very good about
being able to accomplish them. Thank
you very much for creating this valuable
experience and for presenting the oppo
rtunity to Spencer in Mr. Kurz classroom.

Thank you so much for this program! It has
already made a strong impact in Daniella's
life. She has clarified her career goal - event
planner. She enrolled in a speed reading/su
mmer reading program. She is also watching
informative TedTalks, all of which bring matu
rity and personal growth! Just today she he
ard she got selected for an unpaid summer
internship and is excited about working on
a campaign to raise awareness and funds
for Free Arts for Abused Children. She is
doing all of this on her own and I could not
be more proud of her.
