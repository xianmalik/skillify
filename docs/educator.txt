"Skillify met our objective of increasing the confidence level of each studentand preparing them for their mentoring and interning programs. Studentswere actively engaged and practiced networking skills in a highly animatedand beneficial professional setting. Shireen captivated our students withher personal examples from her life and with her enthusiasm. They receiveda great benefit from her workshop on networking. Our students thanked meon the way out for providing this workshop. Their comments were that theyfelt much more connected to each other as an academy and learned theirown commonalities and they learned practical tips like remembering to checktheir emails daily! Thank you!! Skillify exceeded expectations and comeshighly recommended."
