                                    We are so grateful Stephanie was chosen for
                                    this amazing opportunity. She is our oldest
                                    and we didn't get the chance to continue
                                    with college right after high school. She has
                                    worked so hard to live her dream of college
                                    and a career in Physical Therapy. Now with
                                    Skillify we know she is a step closer to
                                    making it a reality.
