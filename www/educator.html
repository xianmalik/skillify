Students were actively engaged and practiced networking skills in a highly animated and beneficial professional setting. Shireen captivated our students with her personal examples from her life and with her enthusiasm. They received a great benefit from her workshop on networking. Our students thanked me on the way out for providing this workshop. Their comments were that they felt much more connected to each other as an academy and learned their own commonalities and they learned practical tips like remembering to check their emails daily! Thank you!! Skillify exceeded expectations and comes highly recommended."

These are real-world skills which students need and, unfortunately, are usually only developed through failure and experience in the school of hard knocks. The services offered by Skillify are current.  Skillify's instructors are close to the age of the students which gives them a great connection and is one reason students are quite engaged. Having the skills taught by Skillify gives students legitimate confidence, exposes them to more opportunities, and shortens their learning curve. This results in quicker immersion into the careers chosen by students and positions them for success. It a program which I needed and would have used when I was in high school. Skillify's programs have been well-attended and students responded exceptionally well to the program."
