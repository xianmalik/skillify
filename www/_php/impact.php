My friends and my parents convinced me to apply. I'm happy I did. Skillify is a great program. Not only did they help me talk to new people, but they also helped me develop and grow my professional skills. All the staff care about you and working with your Student Success Manager is great!! They spend one on one time with you and on anything you need.  Just ask, and they'll be there for you. One of the biggest ways my Student Success Manager helped me was connecting me with professionals in the nursing and computer science field. I had an idea of what I wanted to pursue in college, but I could never narrow it down between nursing or computer programming. Through the calls, I talked to 4 professionals from Skillify. From those four professionals, I was able to connect with two more people. Every adult I called was super friendly and happy to answer my questions. Through weeks of calling, asking questions about their jobs, and asking questions about college, I was able to get a better feel of what path would be best for me. Skillify provides countless opportunities for me. I'm so proud to say I'm a Skillify student."

With the dedicated advice from Jennifer Tang, we worked through building my resume (which employers so far have said is amazing!), wrote letters to event planners, and brainstormed ideas for building my career. The interview techniques and ways to secure an internship have been extremely useful to me. During these past 3 months I have secured a summer internship with the company UPTOGOOD. I created and launched my own campaign, worked with the organization Free Arts, and wrote blogs for their Medium profile. It has been an amazing experience, and the adventure isn’t even over yet! Using the “Informational Interview” format from Skillify, I have successfully contacting an Event Planner in my area with hopes of doing an internship and eventually getting a job at their country club. I am so thankful to Skillify for all they have taught me, and a special thanks to Jennifer Tang’s outstanding help and advice.”

I’m also the Communications Director of the Arcadia Recreation Voluteen Program. Also, I took initiative and contacted my local Senator, Senator Hernandez, to propose a Food Allergy Awareness Bill for Restaurants in California. I personally have food allergies, so I decided to do something that would benefit all. Moreover, I’ve experienced significant personal growth. I’m now able to step out of my comfort zone more easily, as well as talk to people comfortably and make “love connections”. This is a tremendous step in my personal development and is instrumental to my success. Lastly, I have connected with a professor at CalTech, and visited his lab to see if I am interested in the field of environmental science, engineering, etc. I’ve learned a lot from him, and it definitely helped me to decide where my interests were.”

                                    Thank you so much for this program! It has already made a strong impact in Daniella's life. She has clarified her career goal - event planner. She enrolled in a speed reading/summer reading program. She is also watching informative TedTalks, all of which bring maturity and personal growth! Just today she heard she got selected for an unpaid summer internship and is excited about working on a campaign to raise awareness and funds for Free Arts for Abused Children. She is doing all of this on her own and I could not be more proud of her.
